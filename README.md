# Il2CppDumper

Dump strings, pseudo code and proto (specific to pogo) from unity files.  
Most of the complex low level stuff come from here:  
 - https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector
 - https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper
 - Interface extraction from Perfare
 - All pogo specific stuff from me
 - All proto related stuff from me
 - MachO and FatFile support from me
